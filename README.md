## Motivation

</p>

This application was built to monitor Steam market value changes of all `CSGO` Items. It was an attempt at learning the basics of `Web Scraping`

It helps in obtaining an item at a lower price than normal. i.e., It notifies the user when the product value decreases below the desired price. Hence saving money and time that goes wasted on waiting for the prices to fall.

## Usage

For the latest Stable version, go to <a href="https://github.com/SVijayB/Steam_WebScraper/releases">Releases</a>

As an alternative, you could also clone this repository using,
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/SVijayB/Steam_WebScraper.git
</pre>

Extract the files and run `Update.py` file present in the `src` folder.<br>
This is to update your local data (Item skin names). 

Once the update is completed, run the `Steam_WebScraper.py` file present in the `src` folder.

Now, just follow the instructions provided by the application.

**NOTE** : Update your local data using the `Update.py` file after every new CSGO case releases in order to view all the latest skins.
